Steps to create TestNG based framework:
1. Create a maven project
2. Add project specific dependencies: TestNG, Selenium WebDriver, WebDriverManager(bonigarcia),
3. add .gitignore with standard list of files and folders to be ignored
4. Create the package structure (tests, pages, utils)
5. Add maven surefire plugin and configure it to be able to run xml files through CMD
6. Add properties file and a Utility class PropertyReader
7. Add a TestBase class that keeps the common setup and teardown configuration
8. Add Singleton Driver class for proper WebDriver management to prevent multiple instantiation

  -In maven projects, main/java is used for application code whereas test/java is used for test code, it is important to put your tests under test/java
   folder since mvn test command scans the test/java folder for tests.
  - Maven dependency: collection of libraries (jars) that serves a specific purpose
  - Maven plugin: maven's internal tool that performs a specific operation (surefire plugin runs the test)


  - It is important to implement a way to run tests through command line in testing frameworks because tests are run in a remote server and on schedule
     and the only way to launch your tests there would be some cmd command like "mvn test -DxmlFile=regression.xml"


  Page Object Model - a design pattern that is used in UI test automation frameworks where each page of the application is represented by a page class and its elements aere stored in that class
                      Advantages: readability, re-usability, maintainability

  PageFactory - design pattern used specifically in Page Classes to simplify WebElement location through @FindBy annotations.
                A required step for it to work properly is to add a constructor that calls initElements method of PageFactory class to initialize all WebElements.




   Cross Browser Testing can be implemented in various ways. The easiest solution is to use third party cloud based services such as BrowserStack, SauceLabs. Another
                          option is to implement it natively within the framework.
                           - You can pass the browser value through CMD with a -d switch:

   - If you need to run tests in multiple browsers back to back, create a script file with multiple mvn commands:
                      MAC: 1) Create a file with .sh extension
                           2) add #!/bin/bash to the first line
                           3) Add your mvn commands
                           4) Make the script file executable: chmod u+x script_file.sh
                           5) To execute the script file ./script_file.sh

      Windows:            1) Create a file with .bat extension
                          2) Add your mvn commands with call:
                           call mvn test -DxmlFile=smoke_test_suite.xml -Dbrowser=edge
                           call mvn test -DxmlFile=smoke_test_suite.xml -Dbrowser=chrome
                           call mvn test -DxmlFile=smoke_test_suite.xml -Dbrowser=firefox
                          3) To execute the batch file type the name of the file and hit enter batch_file.bat
