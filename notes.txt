Steps to create TestNG based framework:
1. Create a maven project
2. Add project specific dependencies: TestNG, Selenium WebDriver, WebDriverManager(bonigarcia),
3. add .gitignore with standard list of files and folders to be ignored
4. Create the package structure (tests, pages, utils, )





  -In maven projects, main/java is used for application code whereas test/java is used for test code, it is important to put your tests under test/java
   folder since mvn test command scans the test/java folder for tests.
  - Maven dependency: collection of libraries (jars) that serves a specific purpose
  - Maven plugin: maven's internal tool that performs a specific operation (surefire plugin runs the test)
